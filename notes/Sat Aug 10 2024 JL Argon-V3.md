 # Description: 

 here is what i have completed so far, I have finished a script that performs the following function: \n alters the commit message and transforms it to a systematic and organized message and also gives an option to write an 'end of the day' progress report which gives me the ability to make a note of where i left off with any details that might make it easier to work on later. also I have successfully implemented methods that parse digits and strings from lexemes in the lexer or scanner, moving onto reserved words and identifiers. Additionally, to make an ammendment to my latest commit message, I altered the commit message script to potentially automatate the adding of the note file
